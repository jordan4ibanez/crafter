     * (Invisible) Mob idea: pre-recorded laughing track that gets more and more distorted the angrier it gets.
     * 
     * Possible options:
     * 
     * A generic sound on loop in which resets to a more distorted sound clip based on how damaged it is.
     * 
     * Can use the same size as a player.
     * 
     * Not sure if it should even physically attack. Maybe it could just drain your health.
