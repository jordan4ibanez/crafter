# Crafter
 A minetest game written in TypeScript because I felt like it.

(Don't tell anyone that this is crafter)

### How to make this show up in the online content browser

Go here: https://content.minetest.net/help/non_free/

Follow the instructions in ``How can I show non-free packages in the client?``

If you don't like this, don't complain to me.

### Using TS with this thing

If you want to mess with this or maybe you would want to use TS for your minetest things.
 
First you need node, if you're on ubuntu it's super outdated so go to the nodejs website and install it.

**This is developed with the latest version of nodejs/npm**

Next you need TypeScriptToLua, typescript, and nodejs types.
Also, you need Lua types for TS or else the compiler doesn't know what's going on.
```
npm install -D typescript-to-lua typescript @types/node lua-types
```

I HIGHLY recommend you use ``make``. It automates a BUNCH of things. There's even ``make clean`` to see if everything is working.

No make automation scripts created for windows yet though. It's cause I don't run windows.
